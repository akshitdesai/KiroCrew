"""Interactive-path reactive fallback when the account is not entitled to the
configured model.

A new conversation starts on the configured model (commonly the ``auto``
sentinel). When the account is not entitled to it, the prompt-time error is an
ENTITLEMENT rejection, classified terminal -- the two throttle-gated fallback
branches in the chat runner do not fire, so the first reply just fails. The runner
runs the same reactive swap the unattended surfaces run
(``stream_and_collect`` Case 2.5 / ``run_bg_oneliner``): retry ONCE on the first
advertised model the account can run, which is never the failed id and never the
``auto`` sentinel.

These tests pin, through the real ``_run_chat`` ladder:
  - an unentitled named model triggers exactly one ``set_model`` to a non-auto
    advertised id and re-queues the turn on the same session;
  - an account advertising NOTHING accessible surfaces the terminal entitlement
    error with no swap and no re-queue;
  - an unrelated provider error (no rejected model) stays terminal -- the trigger
    is not a catch-all.
